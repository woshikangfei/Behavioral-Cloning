### Overview

Weâ€™ve created a simulator for you based on the Unity engine that uses real game physics to create a close approximation to real driving.

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) 
- [kersar](http://kersar.org/) 

Run this command at the terminal prompt to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Useful for image processing:


### Training data 

I first train the data through the simulator and try to train a model. The resulting training angle is as follows:

### Image Processing

The purpose of image processing is to remove unnecessary data from the image so that the model focuses on the relevant features while away from the computer vision.<br>
The image is processed in three steps:<br>
1, by removing the first 40 pixels of the image (model) because it is useless<br>
2, adjust the image size<br>
3, change the image from RGB to YUV (this really helps smooth the image of the model with less information processing) <br>
The following is the processed image<br>

### Network Architecture

I  using the NVIDIA network architecture described in the course of this article to get the desired output and modify it numerous times.[paper](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)
My implementation process is as follows:<br>
1, from the simulator training data, read the middle of the camera picture and turn angle,<br>
2. Define the nvidia network model<br>
3, training model, using the parameters lr = 0.00001, beta_1 = 0.9, beta_2 = 0.999, epsilon = 1e-08, decay = 0.0<br>
4.Save the training results as model.json and save the weights as model.h5<br>
